To connect to Mongodb create a new cluster on mongodb (there is a free version) and add a new member for database access (save your auto-generated password, you will need it to connect to the database later).
Free version does not allow you to see your database on the web so connect to your database with a MongoDB shell, follow its instruction to download and run the lines in your computer command prompt.
Now to connect your express app to the database, import mongoose and connect to your database using mongoose.connect.
Link is provided through yourMongoDB (on website) -> connect -> connect your application. Replace <password> with your saved database user password.



**IMPORTANT**
If you get error on connecting to your database, you might need to update your IP address in Network Access on the mongodb website.

To connect to database:
1. cd to mongoshell/bin
2. use in computer terminal:
mongosh "mongodb+srv://cluster0.vqyni.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --apiVersion 1 --username Hani

To use the interactive Javascript interface on terminal:

show dbs: list all database
use [database-name]: to switch to a database
show tables: list all tables
db.[table-name].find(): list all entries in table

To observe real-time front-end:
  run ng serve in terminal in project folder

To observe back-end real-time:
  run npm run start:server in terminal in project folder
